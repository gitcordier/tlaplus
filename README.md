# tlaplus
This repo is dedicated to TLA+ specifications. 
Currently, you may find here the specification of a [reversible 
hoist](https://github.com/gitcordier/tlaplus/tree/main/brunelleschi), 
invented by the Renaissance architect Brunelleschi. 
More information and pictures available at the Biomimetics & Dexterous Manipulation Laboratory [website](http://bdml.stanford.edu/Main/BrunelleschiNotes).
